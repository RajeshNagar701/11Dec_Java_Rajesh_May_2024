OOPS

What is OOP in simple words? Object-oriented programming is based on the concept 
of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, 
each with its own properties or attributes. Each object can also contain its own 
procedures or methods.

Software is designed by using objects that interact with one another. 
This offers various benefits, like:

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP provide securities 
OOP code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

Example :



Objects 
Objects are the basic run-time bodies in an object-oriented framework. 
They may represent a place, a person, an account, a table of data, or anything that the 
program needs to handle. Objects can also represent user-defined data such as vectors, time, and lists.

Consider two objects, “customer” and “account” in a program. The customer object may send 
a message requesting the bank balance. 

Classes 
We know that objects hold the data and the functions to manipulate the data. However, 
the two can be bound together in a user-defined data type with the help of classes. Any number of objects can be created in a class. Each object is associated with the data of type class. A class is therefore a collection of objects of similar types. 

For example, consider the class “Fruits”. We can create multiple objects for this class -


Class ===   Fruits / car
Object  ====  apple,banana,orange / volve audi ford

oops Features : 

Class : making group of data members and member function called class
Object 
Encapsulation

Inheritance / Reusability    == extends 
Access Modifier / Visibility  = public / private  / protected  
Polymorphism / overloading / overriding

<!--
In JavaScript, classes are the special type of functions. 
We can define the class just like function declarations and function expressions.

The JavaScript class contains various class members within a body including 
methods or constructor. The class is executed in strict mode. So, the code containing the silent error or mistake throws an error.

The class syntax contains two components:

Class declarations
Class expressions
