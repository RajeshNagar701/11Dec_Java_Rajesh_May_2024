What is Axios?
Axios is a promise-based HTTP client designed for Node.js and browsers. 
With Axios, we can easily send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST APIs and perform create,
 read, update and delete operations. It is an open-source collaboration project 
 hosted on GitHub. It can be imported in plain JavaScript or with any library accordingly. There are two methods to use the AXIOS which are as follows:


When we send a request to the API using Axios, it returns a response. 
The response object consists of: 

data: the data returned from the server.
status: the HTTP code returned from the server.
statusText: the HTTP status returned by the server.
headers: headers obtained from the server.
config: the original request configuration.
request: the request object.
